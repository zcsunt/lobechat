## ‚ú® Features

[![][image-feat-privoder]][docs-feat-provider]

### `1` [Multi-Model Service Provider Support][docs-feat-provider]

In the continuous development of LobeChat, we deeply understand the importance of diversity in model service providers for meeting the needs of the community when providing AI conversation services. Therefore, we have expanded our support to multiple model service providers, rather than being limited to a single one, in order to offer users a more diverse and rich selection of conversations.

In this way, LobeChat can more flexibly adapt to the needs of different users, while also providing developers with a wider range of choices.

#### Supported Model Service Providers

We have implemented support for the following model service providers:

- **AWS Bedrock**: Integrated with AWS Bedrock service, supporting models such as **Claude / LLama2**, providing powerful natural language processing capabilities. [Learn more](https://aws.amazon.com/cn/bedrock)
- **Anthropic (Claude)**: Accessed Anthropic's **Claude** series models, including Claude 3 and Claude 2, with breakthroughs in multi-modal capabilities and extended context, setting a new industry benchmark. [Learn more](https://www.anthropic.com/claude)
- **Google AI (Gemini Pro, Gemini Vision)**: Access to Google's **Gemini** series models, including Gemini and Gemini Pro, to support advanced language understanding and generation. [Learn more](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/)
- **ChatGLM**: Added the **ChatGLM** series models from Zhipuai (GLM-4/GLM-4-vision/GLM-3-turbo), providing users with another efficient conversation model choice. [Learn more](https://www.zhipuai.cn/)
- **Moonshot AI (Dark Side of the Moon)**: Integrated with the Moonshot series models, an innovative AI startup from China, aiming to provide deeper conversation understanding. [Learn more](https://www.moonshot.cn/)
- **Groq**: Accessed Groq's AI models, efficiently processing message sequences and generating responses, capable of multi-turn dialogues and single-interaction tasks. [Learn more](https://groq.com/)
- **OpenRouter**: Supports routing of models including **Claude 3**, **Gemma**, **Mistral**, **Llama2** and **Cohere**, with intelligent routing optimization to improve usage efficiency, open and flexible. [Learn more](https://openrouter.ai/)
- **01.AI (Yi Model)**: Integrated the 01.AI models, with series of APIs featuring fast inference speed, which not only shortened the processing time, but also maintained excellent model performance. [Learn more](https://01.ai/)

At the same time, we are also planning to support more model service providers, such as Replicate and Perplexity, to further enrich our service provider library. If you would like LobeChat to support your favorite service provider, feel free to join our [community discussion](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/discussions/1284).

</div>

[![][image-feat-local]][docs-feat-local]

### `2` [Local Large Language Model (LLM) Support][docs-feat-local]

To meet the specific needs of users, LobeChat also supports the use of local models based on [Ollama](https://ollama.ai), allowing users to flexibly use their own or third-party models.

> \[!TIP]

[![][back-to-top]](#readme-top)

</div>

[![][image-feat-vision]][docs-feat-vision]

### `3` [Model Visual Recognition][docs-feat-vision]

LobeChat now supports OpenAI's latest [`gpt-4-vision`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision) model with visual recognition capabilities,
a multimodal intelligence that can perceive visuals. Users can easily upload or drag and drop images into the dialogue box,
and the agent will be able to recognize the content of the images and engage in intelligent conversation based on this,
creating smarter and more diversified chat scenarios.

This feature opens up new interactive methods, allowing communication to transcend text and include a wealth of visual elements.
Whether it's sharing images in daily use or interpreting images within specific industries, the agent provides an outstanding conversational experience.

<div align="right">

[![][back-to-top]](#readme-top)

</div>

[![][image-feat-tts]][docs-feat-tts]

### `4` [TTS & STT Voice Conversation][docs-feat-tts]

LobeChat supports Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) technologies, enabling our application to convert text messages into clear voice outputs,
allowing users to interact with our conversational agent as if they were talking to a real person. Users can choose from a variety of voices to pair with the agent.

Moreover, TTS offers an excellent solution for those who prefer auditory learning or desire to receive information while busy.
In LobeChat, we have meticulously selected a range of high-quality voice options (OpenAI Audio, Microsoft Edge Speech) to meet the needs of users from different regions and cultural backgrounds.
Users can choose the voice that suits their personal preferences or specific scenarios, resulting in a personalized communication experience.

<div align="right">

[![][back-to-top]](#readme-top)

</div>

[![][image-feat-t2i]][docs-feat-t2i]

### `5` [Text to Image Generation][docs-feat-t2i]

With support for the latest text-to-image generation technology, LobeChat now allows users to invoke image creation tools directly within conversations with the agent. By leveraging the capabilities of AI tools such as [`DALL-E 3`](https://openai.com/dall-e-3), [`MidJourney`](https://www.midjourney.com/), and [`Pollinations`](https://pollinations.ai/), the agents are now equipped to transform your ideas into images.

This enables a more private and immersive creative process, allowing for the seamless integration of visual storytelling into your personal dialogue with the agent.

<div align="right">

[![][back-to-top]](#readme-top)

</div>

[![][image-feat-plugin]][docs-feat-plugin]

### `6` [Plugin System (Function Calling)][docs-feat-plugin]

The plugin ecosystem of LobeChat is an important extension of its core functionality, greatly enhancing the practicality and flexibility of the LobeChat assistant.

<video controls src="https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/f29475a3-f346-4196-a435-41a6373ab9e2" muted="false"></video>

By utilizing plugins, LobeChat assistants can obtain and process real-time information, such as searching for web information and providing users with instant and relevant news.

In addition, these plugins are not limited to news aggregation, but can also extend to other practical functions, such as quickly searching documents, generating images, obtaining data from various platforms like Bilibili, Steam, and interacting with various third-party services.

### `8` [Progressive Web App (PWA)][docs-feat-pwa]

We deeply understand the importance of providing a seamless experience for users in today's multi-device environment.
Therefore, we have adopted Progressive Web Application ([PWA](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361)) technology,
a modern web technology that elevates web applications to an experience close to that of native apps.

Through PWA, LobeChat can offer a highly optimized user experience on both desktop and mobile devices while maintaining its lightweight and high-performance characteristics.
Visually and in terms of feel, we have also meticulously designed the interface to ensure it is indistinguishable from native apps,
providing smooth animations, responsive layouts, and adapting to different device screen resolutions.

> \[!NOTE]
>
> If you are unfamiliar with the installation process of PWA, you can add LobeChat as your desktop application (also applicable to mobile devices) by following these steps:
>
> - Launch the Chrome or Edge browser on your computer.
> - Visit the LobeChat webpage.
> - In the upper right corner of the address bar, click on the <kbd>Install</kbd> icon.
> - Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the PWA Installation.

[![][image-feat-theme]][docs-feat-theme]

### `10` [Custom Themes][docs-feat-theme]

As a design-engineering-oriented application, LobeChat places great emphasis on users' personalized experiences,
hence introducing flexible and diverse theme modes, including a light mode for daytime and a dark mode for nighttime.
Beyond switching theme modes, a range of color customization options allow users to adjust the application's theme colors according to their preferences.
Whether it's a desire for a sober dark blue, a lively peach pink, or a professional gray-white, users can find their style of color choices in LobeChat.

> \[!TIP]
>
> The default configuration can intelligently recognize the user's system color mode and automatically switch themes to ensure a consistent visual experience with the operating system.
> For users who like to manually control details, LobeChat also offers intuitive setting options and a choice between chat bubble mode and document mode for conversation scenarios.

### `A` Deploying with Vercel, Zeabur or Sealos

If you want to deploy this service yourself on either Vercel or Zeabur, you can follow these steps:

- Prepare your [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
- Click the button below to start deployment: Log in directly with your GitHub account, and remember to fill in the `OPENAI_API_KEY`(required) and `ACCESS_CODE` (recommended) on the environment variable section.
- After deployment, you can start using it.
- Bind a custom domain (optional): The DNS of the domain assigned by Vercel is polluted in some areas; binding a custom domain can connect directly.

<div align="center">

#### After Fork

After fork, only retain the upstream sync action and disable other actions in your repository on GitHub.

#### Keep Updated

If you have deployed your own project following the one-click deployment steps in the README, you might encounter constant prompts indicating "updates available." This is because Vercel defaults to creating a new project instead of forking this one, resulting in an inability to detect updates accurately.

> \[!TIP]
>
> We suggest you redeploy using the following steps, [üìò Auto Sync With Latest][docs-upstream-sync]

<br/>

### `B` Deploying with Docker

[![][docker-release-shield]][docker-release-link]
[![][docker-size-shield]][docker-size-link]
[![][docker-pulls-shield]][docker-pulls-link]

We provide a Docker image for deploying the LobeChat service on your own private device. Use the following command to start the LobeChat service:

  --name lobe-chat \
  lobehub/lobe-chat
```

> \[!TIP]
>
> If you need to use the OpenAI service through a proxy, you can configure the proxy address using the `OPENAI_PROXY_URL` environment variable:

```fish
$ docker run -d -p 3210:3210 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx \
  -e OPENAI_PROXY_URL=https://api-proxy.com/v1 \

## üß© Plugins

Plugins provide a means to extend the [Function Calling][docs-functionc-call] capabilities of LobeChat. They can be used to introduce new function calls and even new ways to render message results. If you are interested in plugin development, please refer to our [üìò Plugin Development Guide][docs-plugin-dev] in the Wiki.

- [lobe-chat-plugins][lobe-chat-plugins]: This is the plugin index for LobeChat. It accesses index.json from this repository to display a list of available plugins for LobeChat to the user.
- [chat-plugin-template][chat-plugin-template]: This is the plugin template for LobeChat plugin development.
- [@lobehub/chat-plugin-sdk][chat-plugin-sdk]: The LobeChat Plugin SDK assists you in creating exceptional chat plugins for Lobe Chat.
- [@lobehub/chat-plugins-gateway][chat-plugins-gateway]: The LobeChat Plugins Gateway is a backend service that provides a gateway for LobeChat plugins. We deploy this service using Vercel. The primary API POST /api/v1/runner is deployed as an Edge Function.

> \[!NOTE]
>
> The plugin system is currently undergoing major development. You can learn more in the following issues:
>
> - [x] [**Plugin Phase 1**](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/issues/73): Implement separation of the plugin from the main body, split the plugin into an independent repository for maintenance, and realize dynamic loading of the plugin.
> - [x] [**Plugin Phase 2**](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/issues/97): The security and stability of the plugin's use, more accurately presenting abnormal states, the maintainability of the plugin architecture, and developer-friendly.
> - [x] [**Plugin Phase 3**](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/issues/149): Higher-level and more comprehensive customization capabilities, support for plugin authentication, and examples.
