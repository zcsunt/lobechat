# Identity Verification Service

LobeChat supports the configuration of external identity verification services for internal use within enterprises/organizations to centrally manage user authorization.

Currently supported identity verification services include:

- [Auth0](/en/self-hosting/advanced/sso-providers/auth0)
- [Microsoft Entra ID](/en/self-hosting/advanced/sso-providers/microsoft-entra-id)

Click on the links to view the corresponding platform's configuration documentation.

## Advanced Configuration

To simultaneously enable multiple identity verification sources, please set the `SSO_PROVIDERS` environment variable, separating them with commas, for example, `auth0,azure-ad`.

The order corresponds to the display order of the SSO providers.

| SSO Provider       | Value      |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| Auth0              | `auth0`    |
| Microsoft Entra ID | `azure-ad` |
