  In the application configuration page, you also need to configure Allowed Callback URLs, where you should fill in:

  ```bash
  http(s)://your-domain/api/auth/callback/auth0
  ```

## Advanced Configuration

### Connecting to an Existing Single Sign-On Service

If your enterprise or organization already has a unified identity authentication infrastructure, you can connect to an existing single sign-on service in Applications -> SSO Integrations.

Auth0 supports single sign-on services such as Azure Active Directory, Slack, Google Workspace, Office 365, Zoom, and more. For a detailed list of supported services, please refer to [this link][auth0-sso-integrations].

<Image alt="Connecting to an Existing Single Sign-On Service" src="https://github.com/CloudPassenger/lobe-chat/assets/30863298/32650f4f-d0b0-4843-b26d-d35bad11d8a3" />

### Configuring Social Login

If your enterprise or organization needs to support external user logins, you can configure social login services in Authentication -> Social.

<Image alt="Configuring Social Login" src="https://github.com/CloudPassenger/lobe-chat/assets/30863298/7b6f6a6c-2686-49d8-9dbd-0516053f1efa" />

<Callout type={'warning'}>
  Configuring social login services by default allows anyone to authenticate, which may lead to
  LobeChat being abused by external users.
</Callout>

<Callout>
  If you need to restrict login users, be sure to configure a **blocking policy**: After enabling
  the social login option, refer to [this article][auth0-login-actions-manual] to create an Action
  to set up a blocking/allow list.
