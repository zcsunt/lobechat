Supporting the latest text-to-image generation technology, LobeChat now enables users to directly utilize the Text to Image tool during conversations with the assistant. By harnessing the capabilities of AI tools such as [DALL-E 3](https://openai.com/dall-e-3), [MidJourney](https://www.midjourney.com/), and [Pollinations](https://pollinations.ai/), assistants can now transform your ideas into images. This allows for a more private and immersive creative process.
