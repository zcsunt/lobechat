# Custom Themes

<Image alt={'Custom Themes'} borderless cover src={'https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/9eca103c-9335-4a4c-8192-271a0b857b26'} />

LobeChat places a strong emphasis on personalized user experiences in its interface design, and thus introduces flexible and diverse theme modes, including a light mode for daytime and a dark mode for nighttime.

In addition to theme mode switching, we also provide a series of color customization options, allowing users to adjust the application's theme colors according to their preferences. Whether it's a stable deep blue, a lively peach pink, or a professional gray and white, users can find color choices in LobeChat that match their own style.

  The default configuration can intelligently identify the user's system color mode and
  automatically switch themes to ensure a consistent visual experience with the operating system.

For users who prefer to manually adjust details, LobeChat also provides intuitive setting options and offers a choice between conversation bubble mode and document mode for chat scenes.
